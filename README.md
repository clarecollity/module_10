# Module 10 Challenge

## Introduction
In this challenge, I learned how to prepare data, cluster and optimize clusters, and find the best value for k. By doing this, we can create a portfolio of cryptocurrencies to show a board of directors.

## Using the Code
Before running, make sure scikit-learn and hvPlot are installed on your computer. Do this in a conda environment on your terminal. All other libraries are imported in the first section of the application (like Pandas).
